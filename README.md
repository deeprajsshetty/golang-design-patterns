# Design Pattern Examples with Golang

# SOLID DESIGN PRINCIPLES

# 1. Single Responsibility Principle
     - A type should only have one reason to change
     - Seperation of concerns - different types/packages handling different, independent
       tasks/problems
# 2. Open Closed Principle
     - Types should be open for extension but closed for modification
# 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
     - Not Applicable for GOLANG as it is Typed Language
# 4. Interface Segregation Principle
     - Don't put too much into an interface; split into seperate interfaces
# 5. Dependency Inversion Principle
     - High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
